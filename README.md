# MCQs Creator Application with LangChain and OpenAI ü¶úÔ∏èüîó

This application leverages the LangChain platform and OpenAI API to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on a give pdf file or text file. It also evaluates the answers to these questions, providing a comprehensive tool for education purpose. 
## Overview 
The MCQs Creator application uses variety of technology and libraries to facilitates its functionality:
- LangChain: LangChain is a platform designed to streamline language-based tasks, offering features such as text generation and evaluation 
- OpenAI API: This application integrates with the OpenAI API to access powerful NLP models that allows to generate data 
- Streamlit: The user interface of the application is built using streamlit, is a python library for creating interactive web appplications 

## Features 
## 1. File Upload 
Users can upload pdf pr text files containing data from which MCQs will be generated 
## 2. MCQ Generation 
After user upload file, users can specify the number of questions they wish to generate, as well as the subject and the complexity level of the questions. 
## 3. Evaluation 
MCQs are evaluated using LangChain's capabilities which provides insights into their effectiveness and relevance
